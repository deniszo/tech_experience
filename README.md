### Tech Experience repository

## Motivation
This repo is being created to have a wide overview of the tech I am facing/learning/want to learn. As a software engineer I strive to learn new technology, but along with joy of solving problems and the moments when the new library/framework/technology 'clicks' and everything becomes very clear, comes frustration as seems like now, when you've stepped your feet into the whole new world, you know less than you've known before you started to learn.

I also want to be more deliberate on my career path and (yeah that's all what I've started for) praise myself for the progress I make.

## The contract
This idea is based on this [2017 Web Developer Road Map](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/a-roadmap-to-becoming-a-web-developer-in-2017-b6ac3dddd0cf) post on Medium. It really is exciting and at the same time scary how many things are there on the map (though it doesn't cover anything from Functional programming world, which I do love and really interested in). I don't think I will be doing all of those, but most of the branches of that map are definitelly need to be known and mastered at some degree by a perofessional I am trying to become. 

I will be tracking my progress along with a kind of blog-posting here on github. I haven't established the structure I am going to follow yet, but here are a couple of things I am going to start with:
* [Current Path](#current-path) section will contain the links to the folders on technologies I am learning righ now
* Each techonology folder will hold a similar readme with the reasons and motivation to learn it, my progress and the outcome wich will be added along the way, because learning things without applying them in real life doesn't make sense to me.
* At the end of this file I will have a [list of techonologies and scores](#tech-list) which I would give myself on the basis of my knowledge of them (they will be suuuuper subjective :)). Each score is arguable, so when I am giving the 10, I consider myself as a master of technology who has nothing to learn of it left (I foresee it will never ever happen, but who cares). If I place 0, It means I've heard of the techonology, but have no hands-on experience with it (will happen each time I am starting with the tech). I tend to be very strict regarding the asessment my own skills, but I believe it is for good.

At the end of each week I will add a post in the [Progress](#progress) section with the results and further study planning.

Personally I don't think I am able to focus on a lot things at the same time (I have a work to get done actually :)), but making one tiny step at a time day-by-day brings incredible results and joy. I'll track time with the Toggl app and will have a board at Trello for each task I am working on.

## <a name="tech-list"></a>Technology experience list
Here is a list of the techonologies I have any experience with (0 - means "have seen a couple of articles")
* [Frontend](#skills-frontend). This is a section where most of my professional life is happening
* [Backend](#skills-backend). I am very interested in backend stuff and everything that goes with it. Right now I do only NodeJS related tasks, which I always try to excel and ship the best code I can
